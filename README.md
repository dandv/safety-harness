### Disclaimer

**NOTE:  Safety-Harness is 85% complete, and am taking a break.  
What you see on http://safety-harness.meteor.com/ is what you get.**


### Status Update

Note:  Continous integration is currently set to run on page load, code hot-reload, and on file-save.  That means the continous integration currently is event-driven.  There are new controls at the bottom of the application that allow you to set an integration interval.  This feature is only half-implemented.  The interval control works just fine.  It's just that the test runner hasn't been abstracted so that it has an API hook to call at the interval.  So, in the meantime, I just put an alert.  Bottom line.... the continuous integration buttons don't do anything except create a timer that counts down and displays a popup alert.  And the test-runner is still tied to the page onload event.  (But the test will run on LiveEdit, so it totally works for continous integtation, if you want.)


### Basic Installation

**Get Your App Running**  
1. Run the app you're building locally with ``sudo mrt``  
2. Or maybe deploy it using ``sudo mrt deploy my-todo-example.meteor.com``.   
3. Or maybe to Modulus with a ``sudo demeteorizer; cd .demoeteorized; sudo modulus deploy``.  

**Update Your App So It Can Work With Safety Harness**  
4a.  Add iron-router package with ``sudo mrt add iron-router``  
4b.  Add XmlHttpRequest access control headers to your router in the app you're testing?

````js
Router.map(function () {
  this.route('testRoute', {
  }, function () {
    this.response.setHeader('access-control-allow-origin', '*');
    this.response.write('hello world');
    this.response.end(); // not necessary because the wrapper does this
  });
});  
````

**Get Safety-Harness Running**  
5.  Clone the safety-harness repository.  
6.  Run safety-harness locally with ``sudo mrt``  
7.  Or run it on a separate port using ``sudo mrt -p 3200``  
8.  Deploy your updated app again (now with access control headers!) using ``sudo mrt deploy my-todo-example.meteor.com``  
9.  Or maybe to Modulus again with another ``sudo demeteorizer; cd .demoeteorized; sudo modulus deploy``. Note:  you will need to deploy Safety-Harness to a separate project and domain name.

**Update Your DNS To Allow Cross-Subdomain Scripting**  
10. Set up A records and CNAME records in your DNS, as necessary.  

**Configure Safety-Harness**  
11.  Maybe update the ``browser_window_location`` in the file ``main.js``?  


**Review Existing Tests**  
12.  Once all that's set up, check out the following files, which should have everything you need to get started.
````js
// server side proxy functions
server/proxy.methods.http.js
server/proxy.methods.phantomjs.js

// client side tests
tests/tests.server.phantomjs.js
tests/tests.server.http.js
tests/tests.chai.http.js
````

**Write Some Tests**  
13.  Start writing tests by editing a file like ``tests\tests.examples.todos.js``.  
14.  Or create your own file such as ``tests\tests.myapp.js``.  
15.  Add new files to the ``tests`` direction by editing ``packages\mocha-runner\package.js``.  (Yes, it's hacky.  Need to fix this.)  
16.  Extend the ``proxy.methods.phantomjs.js`` file.  
17.  Or copy the ``proxy.methods.phantomjs.js`` file into a ``proxy.methods.myapp.js`` file.  

### Help Fix Bugs

Accepting pull requests for the following items:

**1. need to be able to share a PhantomJS object between tests** (i.e. proxy Meteor.method() calls)  
2. anything that documents and improves the XmlHttpRequest same-origin workaround proxy  
3. need to add async futures to the ``proxy.methods.phantomjs.js`` file  
4. need to create a Deps.autorun singleton wrapper around the PhantomJS object  
5. actually want to un-package the ``packages/mocha-runner`` files, and bring them into the core app, if possible  
6. particularly with regard to having to specify test files by adding entries into ``packages/mocha-runner/package.js``
